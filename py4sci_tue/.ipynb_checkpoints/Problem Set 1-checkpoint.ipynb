    "This problem set is about DNA data and methods typically applied to this kind of data. As a reminder, [DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) is a molecule that encodes genetic instructions for living organisms. DNA is typically found as a double-stranded helix, in which each strand corresponds to a sequence of *nucleotides*. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase (guanine, adenine, thymine, or cytosine) attached to sugars, which are in turn separated from each other by phosphate groups:\n",
